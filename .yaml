  Our project is a machine learning library written in OCaml
  that implements the Random Forest algorithm from scratch.
  It supports both classification and regression tasks, with
  features like bootstrapped sampling, feature randomness, and 
  handling of both discrete and continuous attributes.

  In addition to a modular and extensible core library, the 
  project includes a graphical user interface for training models 
  and visualizing decision boundaries, predictions, and performance metrics.
